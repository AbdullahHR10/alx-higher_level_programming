| Requirement | README.md | Contains the readme of this project. |
| 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing | 0-positive_or_negative.py | Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed, then prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative. |
| 1. The last digit | 1-last_digit.py |  Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed, then prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable number. |
| 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game | 2-print_alphabet.py | Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. |
| 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off | 3-print_alphabt.py | Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet except `q` and `e` , in lowercase, not followed by a new line. |

| 5. 00...99 | 5-print_comb2.py | Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99. |
| 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need | Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| 7. islower | 7-islower.py | Python function that checks for lowercase character. |
| 8. To uppercase | 8-uppercase.py | Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. |
| 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important | Python function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| 10. a + b | 10-add.py | Python function that adds two integers and returns the result. |
| 11. a ^ b | 11-pow.py | Python function that computes a to the power of b and return the value. |

| 13. Insert in sorted linked list | 13-insert_number.c, lists.h | Technical interview preparation, C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. |
| 14. Smile in the mirror | 100-print_tebahpla.py | Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line. |
| 15. Remove at position | 101-remove_char_at.py | Python function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”). |
| 16. ByteCode -> Python #2 | 102-magic_calculation.py | Python function that does exactly the same as a Python bytecode. |
